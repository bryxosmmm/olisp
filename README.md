# O'lisp 

O'lisp is compiller for lisp language, written in ocaml.

## Goals
Basicaly for now i want it to have the ability to use functions from libc.
In future maybe it became normal language.

## Examples
```lisp
(printf "Hello %s\n" "world")
```

```lisp
(putchar 69)
```

## Notes 
So far it can do basic stuff with libc, can use binexpr for libc args.
Now i want implement if statement;
